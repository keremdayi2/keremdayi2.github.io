## About me
I am currently a 4th year undergraduate at Harvard College, working towards an A.B. in Computer Science and Mathematics and an S.M. in Computer Science. I am interested in _foundational problems in important applications_. Outside of work, I am very involved with music as the bass guitarist of the band 'When in Doubt' and play the electric and bass guitars (+ a little bit of piano).

I was fortunate to be able to work on many research problems as an undergraduate. Currently, I am working on **rigorously understanding low-rank fine-tuning** and am advised by Prof. <span style="color:#AA0000">[Sitan Chen](https://sitanchen.com)</span>. Previously, I worked on **resilience and distributed optimization** in multi-agent systems, advised by Prof. <span style="color:#AA0000">[Stephanie Gil](https://react.seas.harvard.edu/people/stephanie-gil)</span> and Prof. <span style="color:#AA0000">[Angelia Nedich](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=86PxxsoAAAAJ&hl=en)</span>.
