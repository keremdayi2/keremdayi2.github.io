description = "We design and analyze a projected-gradient based resilient distributed algorithm to make distributed optimization more resilient to adversarial attacks. While ensuring resiliency and distributed computation, this algorithm matches the geometric convergence rate obtained for strongly-convex functions in non-robust, centralized settings."
