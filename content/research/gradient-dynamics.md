description = "We rigorously analyze SGD on learning rank-1 perturbations of two-layer neural networks beyond the kernel regime. We show that fine-tuning sits between the kernel-regime and the feature learning regime, and we can prove complexity rigorous separations between fine-tuning and 'learning from scratch'"
